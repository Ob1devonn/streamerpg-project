            </h2>

            <p>
                Like with many other hobbies, there is somewhere to start.
                It is usually the bottom. There are not many who can strive successfully
                from the start. So understand that it can be a slow pace of growth and frustration. 
                It might even take someone several months to figure out their niche,
                let alone content to even make. <br><br>

            </p>


            <h3>
                Orientation
            </h3>

            <p>
                There is a list of methods for getting exposure, but it can be equally
                important to be able to keep up with your fans consistently.
                Sometimes it has to be something as small as checking in on them from time to time, or
                even as simple as a blog. The fact of the matter is many who follow you are there
                for a reason. That reason being you. It could be for the quality
                of the content, or even the nature of it, but 80% of the time
                it has to deal with your persona/personality. <br><br>
                It is important to focus content, but what good is a fan-base if
                they truly do not appreciate you for being you. Anyone can show 
                up on a webcam and talk, but it takes a certain person to make someone
                comeback and listen to the things you have to say, even watch the media you put out.
                Knowing this also means that you understand there is a need to be filtered. There is
                a threshold you need to understand, when creating, you become an idol or a role model for some.
                You may not think it, but someone you know could be on the other end of the screen. Just remember 
                there is a need for modesty and decorum.

            <h3>
                Start
            </h3>

                Majority of the time, creators will release anything that comes to mind, and that is 
                it is part of the process. Many media sites will have data insights for tracking progress
                and provide feedback on some areas that might stimulate further growth. That is fine and dandy,
                but you maybe wondering, "where do I truly start? How do I know what to get, to edit my videos, photos 
                or even stream?" It is called a process for a reason. For me, it took me several months to even release
                my first edited video, and even that only receive a handful of recognition. With most content, you will 
                have to research some of the forms of editing. It is a raw occasion for raw content to be rich quality-wise.

            </h4>

            <p>
                Streaming can be fun, but it can lead to very limited growth. Many streaming platforms, will post your content
                for a limited time before removing it ending any possible extension of growth from that source. What could
                we do in order to ensure someone looking for you content finds it? Creating a Youtube might be ideal. As long as
                your video is within community guidelines, it'll have a chance to be discovered, or even provide a long-term 
                storage for your content.
