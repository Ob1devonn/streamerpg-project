00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:05.460
hello and welcome this is going to be a

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.820
quick tutorial on how to get the basics

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.019
of your OBS correctly that way you could

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.480
do

5
00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.680
relatively easy screen shares and

6
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.180
anything that has to do with streaming

7
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.680
first off of course you're going to want

8
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.840
to open obs

9
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.619
to get that loaded up you may get some

10
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.140
prompts for updates and stuff like that

11
00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.640
typically what you want to do is on

12
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.859
first startup you want to make sure all

13
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.320
your settings are set up properly

14
00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.239
a lot of the time with OBS the way it

15
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.840
goes is it'll have an automatic

16
00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.460
configuration for your system which may

17
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.440
or may not be good

18
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.840
um that is all dependent on what kind of

19
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.920
specs you are running I'm running a

20
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:54.300
an RTX 2070 super with a uh was it a

21
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.340
ryzen 5 uh 3600 and it's not it's not

22
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.699
the best but it's obviously not the

23
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.480
worst uh typically with this you might

24
00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.780
want to upgrade uh or change your theme

25
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.920
they got several different types as you

26
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.060
can see uh my favorite is yummy

27
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.100
um

28
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.560
typically by default these are all

29
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.780
clicked on this is completely up to your

30
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.280
preference I typically have them off

31
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.320
because I don't really need the

32
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.360
confirmation that it's going live or

33
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.180
it's starting recording it's relatively

34
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.540
annoying after you go through the uh

35
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.659
first bit of streaming let me reopen

36
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.659
this

37
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.460
when you first go around you you'll

38
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.740
obviously customize this to your fitting

39
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.540
there's a lot of pers uh preference

40
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.659
based

41
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.479
oh if you like Studio mode if you want

42
00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.240
it to be a certain orientation uh

43
00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.280
anything in that just if you wanted to

44
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.899
open in the background on Startup most

45
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.240
people don't but

46
00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.439
that's clearly up to you

47
00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.939
um this is where you would put your

48
00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.380
stream key and where you're streaming to

49
00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.780
you can stream to all these different

50
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.680
platforms you have presets

51
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.020
um

52
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.580
can be relatively important especially

53
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.000
if

54
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.040
say you started to stream and then

55
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.140
you notice it wasn't working or wasn't

56
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.280
broadcasting that would most likely be

57
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.080
either

58
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.080
on your um

59
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.420
your side the server side or it could be

60
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.940
your stream key most of the time it's

61
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.500
probably going to be a stream key I know

62
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.440
with a lot of content creators on

63
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.800
Facebook they typically cycle the stream

64
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.900
keep by 48 hours to prevent people from

65
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.580
getting access and

66
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.560
you don't really want anyone else to

67
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.300
have access to that that's it's like

68
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.640
having a MAC address you do a whole lot

69
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.340
of damage

70
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.280
next would be output it's going to be

71
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.180
how your settings are going to be set I

72
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.340
have mine set to Advanced because I sort

73
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.860
of know the formatting and what my

74
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.440
computer can handle

75
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:04.500
by default it's usually on

76
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.780
um I think this setting is normal or

77
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.920
regular or something like that

78
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:14.760
um that's for like those who aren't very

79
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.800
format based or know the formats

80
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.800
um

81
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.540
that can also be a preference as well uh

82
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.159
typically you're going to start on the

83
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.900
streaming side that's if you plan on

84
00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:30.180
streaming you're going to have all these

85
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.180
formats from my understanding uh cqp

86
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.860
which is like constant quality

87
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.360
um something something along those lines

88
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.840
this the all these formats go off of

89
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.120
different uh like

90
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.040
okay so utilization what kind of

91
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.620
resources it Bulls like this one is bit

92
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.260
rate so it's based off of bits I think

93
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.739
it runs off of

94
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.860
internet if I am not wrong myself

95
00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.560
um can you have presets and a tuning and

96
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.379
how many passages it'll go through

97
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.040
um in the profile of like

98
00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:11.280
how the computer will prioritize this so

99
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.200
you could set it from Main Baseline to

100
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.420
underneath and then High

101
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.060
then you'd have stuff like like a head

102
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:22.040
and this basically getting powder is

103
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:27.620
going through encoding the uh B frames

104
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.620
then there's psycho tuning

105
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:37.880
typically just helps with the High um

106
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.979
High emotions but then you get the GPU

107
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.900
and the Max B frames some of the stuff

108
00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.400
can be tweaked um I typically use leave

109
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.060
them default because most of the time

110
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.160
it's already preset and already encoded

111
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.080
next would be recordings as you can see

112
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.639
it's in standard

113
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.259
um you can even change it I think

114
00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.600
there's also an advanced mode for this

115
00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.919
and it gets really into depth but I

116
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.240
don't recommend it

117
00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.400
um most of the time what you want to do

118
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.620
is you're going to want to have a folder

119
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.600
that you have or you can leave it in the

120
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.880
default which is most of the time it's

121
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.120
going to be your uh

122
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.100
what is it your windows video folder or

123
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.900
if you're on a Mac it's probably the

124
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.460
default

125
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.620
um pathway for that

126
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.680
now as you can see there's all these

127
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.020
options like I could generate a file

128
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.940
name without spacing I could change the

129
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.100
format which I'm currently recording in

130
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.100
MP4 I don't recommend this because as

131
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:35.880
you can see the warning Below in MP4 and

132
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:39.060
mov it will not be recoverable if and at

133
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:42.080
any point it 10 if it crashes or

134
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:46.919
anything along the line of your um

135
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:48.720
your video not coming to a proper end

136
00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.940
um so like if like

137
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.740
some reason your culture crashes it's

138
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.300
not going to save the progress

139
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.240
and you're gonna get just gonna get a

140
00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:00.620
corrupt file the best format to use is

141
00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:04.680
uh MKV in my personal preference because

142
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:07.380
though it does take a bit more as you

143
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.300
can see you can have multiple audio

144
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.300
tracks

145
00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.860
um it's easy for you to uh remix because

146
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.620
all you got to do is uh

147
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:19.020
go let me exit out this real quick all

148
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.120
you got to do is go up here and then OBS

149
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.380
has a

150
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:27.360
remixer which is going to convert it

151
00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:30.419
from MKV MKV to a format that you choose

152
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.100
I think it's just MP4 by default

153
00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:34.440
that's really good for like um if you're

154
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:38.220
using a video editor that only accepts

155
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.840
MP4 or I think it's mov or something

156
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.280
like that

157
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.160
anyways

158
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.960
um so as you know the output has the

159
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.460
recording settings as well and then

160
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.860
these are going to be audio tracks that

161
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:54.660
you could set

162
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:56.880
you can have it isolated and

163
00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.960
I don't think it's here

164
00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.759
but

165
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.060
yeah so it's for the audio tracks you

166
00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:04.259
could isolate them so I have two for I

167
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.319
think

168
00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:08.880
I have two for the stream itself so like

169
00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:11.699
what everyone is hearing on that side

170
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:14.100
now that's no no that's my desktop

171
00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:16.620
that's the desktop audio and three would

172
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:19.080
be my mic so I'd have these two on a

173
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:21.060
separate audio file just in case I've

174
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.400
had to retweak them like let's say I'm

175
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:26.160
playing a game it gets too loud and then

176
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:29.340
you can't hear me so I gotta tweak it so

177
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.860
my gain on my um my three track is a

178
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:34.620
whole lot better I typically

179
00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:37.440
um have it set so my audio track is one

180
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:39.900
for streaming because you have audio

181
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.880
tracks as well but you don't want them

182
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:45.720
to overlap when you're doing recordings

183
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.979
because it caused a bit of an issue it's

184
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.080
not fun to play with

185
00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:51.000
so audio track I typically leave for one

186
00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.740
for streaming and then for everything

187
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.599
else I have two and three those are

188
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:57.120
reserved for separate individuals so

189
00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:59.280
this is like a this one would be like my

190
00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.740
streaming and my talking I mean this

191
00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:04.080
would be the desktop or whatever game

192
00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:05.039
I'm playing and my talking and this

193
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.319
would be

194
00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:09.599
um this would be my desktop or the game

195
00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:12.419
I'm playing and then maybe my talking

196
00:08:09.599 --> 00:08:14.460
uh the way that works is

197
00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:15.660
you can go let's say you have an audio

198
00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.280
Source here

199
00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:19.560
one of these two a lot of these sources

200
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:22.379
I have them uh in a Direct Read though

201
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:25.740
it's easier for me to understand it

202
00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:26.340
you're typically going to go here to the

203
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.259
um

204
00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.599
the audio mixer you're going to go to

205
00:08:28.259 --> 00:08:32.279
Advanced Audio properties and then

206
00:08:30.599 --> 00:08:34.860
you're going to set the tracks so as you

207
00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:37.020
can see this is my mic I was wrong

208
00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.458
it's on oh that was right yeah it's on

209
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.440
one and three

210
00:08:38.458 --> 00:08:43.260
so it has its own separate file on three

211
00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:45.000
yeah that typically when I record it's

212
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.800
not going to catch one because then I

213
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.959
don't have overlays and I set it to two

214
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.959
and three only

215
00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:55.500
so for the stream audio as you can tell

216
00:08:51.959 --> 00:08:59.399
uh it's gonna go two and three and then

217
00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:02.880
that's basically just like my gameplay

218
00:08:59.399 --> 00:09:06.180
uh I don't know why I have it on three

219
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:07.500
it's just basically like my gameplay and

220
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.080
um

221
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:12.420
It's Gonna Catch like anything along the

222
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.040
lines of

223
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.140
like if I have Discord open it'll catch

224
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:19.880
those that audio it's all coming from my

225
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.880
computer it's gonna go through too

226
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.800
now it's because three I have set for um

227
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.600
are we supposed to be my stream I don't

228
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.459
know I reset it on

229
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.839
my settings it's weird

230
00:09:29.459 --> 00:09:32.580
must have been because I switched to

231
00:09:30.839 --> 00:09:35.040
format

232
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:37.380
normally it's set to three all right

233
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.820
it's important because every now and

234
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.680
then if you switch formats it will

235
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.600
definitely change your settings so you

236
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:45.240
need to memorize these otherwise

237
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:48.300
kit by two in the butt

238
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:51.060
so as I'm going on what you will notice

239
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.620
is the encoder encoders

240
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.940
um they vary it depends on what kind of

241
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:56.779
components you're running

242
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:59.760
as I've listed in my recommendations tab

243
00:09:56.779 --> 00:10:02.700
you can have an assortment of different

244
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:05.899
types of

245
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:08.700
um processing units such as CPUs or gpus

246
00:10:05.899 --> 00:10:10.620
uh graphics card you typically want to

247
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:12.480
do the running depending on how strong

248
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:16.620
it is because if you're playing a video

249
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:19.680
game you're um the coder

250
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:21.120
I mean for the video game typically a

251
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.760
lot of the workload is going to go on

252
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.380
the CPU depending on how they have the

253
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:28.080
game formatted

254
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:30.300
now you can go through and

255
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:33.660
customizing encoder settings and go

256
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:35.040
further on about that but unless you

257
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.839
know what you're doing and looked into

258
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:39.360
it I wouldn't recommend changing any of

259
00:10:36.839 --> 00:10:41.160
the encoder settings unless you know

260
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.060
what you're doing

261
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.800
um

262
00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:46.079
next would be audio you don't want to

263
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.060
really change that or the replay buffer

264
00:10:46.079 --> 00:10:49.860
you can change that to have free play

265
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:52.380
like in your stream you can have like a

266
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:54.180
key or you can have your um

267
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.279
stream have access to it and then they

268
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:59.279
can play Replay and have like a little

269
00:10:56.279 --> 00:11:02.940
screen it plays like a little video of

270
00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:06.060
the last 20 seconds or then on another

271
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.920
tab here is the audio tab uh you want to

272
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:10.440
leave that at 48 kilohertz

273
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:13.440
um stereo is pretty good I think you

274
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:15.480
could change it to Mono

275
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.600
I'm not sure if that's correct but

276
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:22.079
typically I use I use a

277
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:24.839
a audio interface so I don't typically

278
00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:27.959
use these by default these are usually

279
00:11:24.839 --> 00:11:30.120
set up in a way where if you don't have

280
00:11:27.959 --> 00:11:32.640
an audio file I mean an audio Source

281
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:34.980
down here it'll play regardless so I

282
00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:39.000
have it tapered to the way I can isolate

283
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:40.260
my audio as such so my mic and my stream

284
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.779
audio

285
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:46.620
and it's all separated and it comes out

286
00:11:42.779 --> 00:11:48.779
very crisp when I go through and edit it

287
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.399
I don't want to you could change this if

288
00:11:48.779 --> 00:11:52.860
you'd like it's completely up to

289
00:11:50.399 --> 00:11:55.019
preference I use um my third party which

290
00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.279
is a voice meter it's pretty good if you

291
00:11:55.019 --> 00:12:00.120
know what you're doing it can be

292
00:11:56.279 --> 00:12:02.519
relatively confusing later on but that's

293
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:06.140
something you would have to get into

294
00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:08.820
there's options for ducking and latency

295
00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:11.880
you can even have

296
00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:14.459
um hot keys for like muting

297
00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:16.320
and then for the videos you typically

298
00:12:14.459 --> 00:12:18.180
want this to be

299
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.040
whatever your screen is this is wrong

300
00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:21.839
because my screen is

301
00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:24.839
um

302
00:12:21.839 --> 00:12:28.019
I think it's it's a really weird I think

303
00:12:24.839 --> 00:12:29.399
it's like a 2024 I don't know it's a

304
00:12:28.019 --> 00:12:32.399
weird resolution

305
00:12:29.399 --> 00:12:34.560
um it's probably twice this

306
00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:36.420
um that's typically what you wanted to

307
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:39.060
do is you wanted to have your screen

308
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:40.800
size for the first one of your space and

309
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:43.440
the output which is going to be your

310
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.899
viewers screen size most of the time

311
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:50.040
it's just 1920 so

312
00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:53.519
that's important but if you were to like

313
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:55.920
perhaps uh it's if you're recording for

314
00:12:53.519 --> 00:12:58.500
tick tock this would be opposite from

315
00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:01.560
what I understand because it's a it's a

316
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:05.760
9 by 16 ratio for the cell phones

317
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:08.040
but that that that's for another video

318
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:10.620
um typically when you downscale

319
00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:12.480
um you're gonna have like bi-linear a

320
00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:15.180
couple other versions

321
00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:17.760
um I'm not gonna go into that yet

322
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:19.399
because it's not it's not it is

323
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.720
important but at the same time it's not

324
00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:23.339
all too important unless you know what

325
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.120
you're doing same thing with the frame

326
00:13:23.339 --> 00:13:25.079
rates

327
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.459
um

328
00:13:25.079 --> 00:13:29.339
frame rates you got to keep this in mind

329
00:13:26.459 --> 00:13:31.860
with certain games and certain videos

330
00:13:29.339 --> 00:13:33.660
like unless you're

331
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:36.240
doing gameplay

332
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:38.760
probably don't want to do anything above

333
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:41.100
30 because kid get relatively weird with

334
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:43.680
frame rates it's not more the better

335
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:46.079
it's it it basically it's just how many

336
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:48.000
frames you have per second

337
00:13:46.079 --> 00:13:52.019
that's the literal definition of frames

338
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.760
per second so for FPS you um for video

339
00:13:52.019 --> 00:13:56.279
games to catch smaller actions you

340
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:59.639
typically want more frames or like if

341
00:13:56.279 --> 00:14:02.880
you're doing like uh self-recording with

342
00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:05.639
like a Blog of yourself the camera I

343
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:08.160
recommend leaving at around 30 maybe

344
00:14:05.639 --> 00:14:11.100
even 24 because that's

345
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:15.300
that's just how we kind of receive it

346
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:17.880
anything faster than like 30 and it's a

347
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:19.440
face cam it kind of looks weird there's

348
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.959
been there's like tests that'll talk

349
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:24.120
about how um

350
00:14:21.959 --> 00:14:26.160
they had done a recording in a faster uh

351
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:29.399
frame per second and it just looked very

352
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:31.320
janky and stuttery but that's that's for

353
00:14:29.399 --> 00:14:33.420
another video as well here you have your

354
00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:36.779
hotkeys a lot of these are important

355
00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:38.880
because these are your safe nuts

356
00:14:36.779 --> 00:14:41.459
so you don't have to go through and have

357
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.199
to go into your um settings it's really

358
00:14:41.459 --> 00:14:45.839
important especially if you only have

359
00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:47.639
one screen you're streaming to that

360
00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:50.399
you don't want to typically have to

361
00:14:47.639 --> 00:14:52.560
multitask or have to pull this up every

362
00:14:50.399 --> 00:14:54.660
time because some sometimes when you are

363
00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:56.579
in some applications they

364
00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:59.699
screen lock you and they won't let you

365
00:14:56.579 --> 00:15:03.680
drift off into another screen for your

366
00:14:59.699 --> 00:15:03.680
the purpose of usability

367
00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:08.940
as you go through you can I don't know

368
00:15:06.779 --> 00:15:10.139
what the limit for the key inputs are I

369
00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:12.420
would imagine you wouldn't want to do

370
00:15:10.139 --> 00:15:14.220
more than three and that sounds like it

371
00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:17.760
would get really complicated but I have

372
00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:19.920
it so it's a combination of two keys

373
00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:22.860
so I'll have like

374
00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:25.199
a combination specifically for my stream

375
00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:28.139
so hotkeys will be like this one's

376
00:15:25.199 --> 00:15:31.680
really going because I don't know many

377
00:15:28.139 --> 00:15:34.860
um operator Windows hotkeys that are

378
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:38.459
preset to this by System default but I

379
00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:41.519
use uh a shift alt and I'll use left and

380
00:15:38.459 --> 00:15:44.699
right for like recording it's dedicated

381
00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:48.139
and then I think of this as my screen is

382
00:15:44.699 --> 00:15:48.139
up or my stream is down

383
00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:52.860
there's some other hotkeys that aren't

384
00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.959
on here because

385
00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:57.720
this is updated and it

386
00:15:54.959 --> 00:16:00.480
wiped my my settings to default but

387
00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.980
that's fine because that's

388
00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.959
that's just something we have to deal

389
00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:07.980
with here is

390
00:16:03.959 --> 00:16:09.959
um the advanced tab uh I think this is

391
00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:11.820
yeah this is a processing

392
00:16:09.959 --> 00:16:14.160
um priority so like

393
00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.779
if you want this to be over other

394
00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.240
applications that you currently are

395
00:16:15.779 --> 00:16:20.699
running you put it on high you put it on

396
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.800
below normal it's just to determine what

397
00:16:20.699 --> 00:16:24.000
kind of processing it needs you don't

398
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.279
want to mess with any of this stuff

399
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.339
unless you know what you're doing

400
00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:31.920
um this is just a format it's in I don't

401
00:16:29.339 --> 00:16:33.779
know what kind of script this is but the

402
00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.620
way it's written is

403
00:16:33.779 --> 00:16:36.959
um

404
00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:40.380
I think it's like

405
00:16:36.959 --> 00:16:43.800
I think YY is here so it's like Century

406
00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:46.380
Century year year month month day day

407
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:48.779
hour hour then

408
00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:50.820
a minute minute and second second

409
00:16:48.779 --> 00:16:54.060
I think that's just like the preset for

410
00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:56.220
the and that that's like the default you

411
00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:59.160
can um choose to override existing files

412
00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:00.480
or automatically remix this this is

413
00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.100
relatively

414
00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.319
um tedious especially if it's a big file

415
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.880
at the end of your stream the last thing

416
00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:08.339
you want to do is sit there and let this

417
00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:10.140
load out because

418
00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:12.599
um you can have like my my files are

419
00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:15.419
typically around like 10 gigabytes per

420
00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:17.359
video and that's only like probably a

421
00:17:15.419 --> 00:17:20.339
couple hours probably of film or footage

422
00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:22.199
and uh if you have this set out on it

423
00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:24.599
I've noticed it takes quite a bit of

424
00:17:22.199 --> 00:17:28.260
time to process and then code re-code it

425
00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:30.720
to that format and it can

426
00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:33.179
sit there and

427
00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:36.240
also I think I think when it does it for

428
00:17:33.179 --> 00:17:38.039
me it sometimes crashes so I just leave

429
00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.840
it alone I'll remix it when I get ready

430
00:17:38.039 --> 00:17:41.580
to edit it you can have your stream

431
00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:43.200
delay just in case if you or you're

432
00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:45.240
worried about um stream snipers you just

433
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:48.120
enable this and then you can set the how

434
00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.080
many seconds it's really good

435
00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.460
um

436
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.400
a lot of these you got to be careful

437
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:55.200
with because if you hover over and then

438
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:58.440
you move your mouse well as you can see

439
00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:01.380
it'll change the settings and you have

440
00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:04.020
to go through and reset your settings

441
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:05.700
um this is Network typically you

442
00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:08.360
probably won't mess with this

443
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:10.740
you could have this enabled for uh no

444
00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:12.419
optimization what it'll think it is

445
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:15.140
what'll sit there is it'll probably

446
00:18:12.419 --> 00:18:18.660
capture some some packages just to see

447
00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:22.500
how fast it's going and just optimize

448
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:25.200
how your stream should be set up I don't

449
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:27.299
normally use it so I probably wouldn't

450
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:30.120
recommend it the dynamic changing bit

451
00:18:27.299 --> 00:18:31.919
rate on the other hand is very useful

452
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.900
because there are times especially if

453
00:18:31.919 --> 00:18:35.480
you're on your screen or in your

454
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:41.460
settings and using

455
00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:44.039
a bit rate for your um for your encoder

456
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:46.440
can fluctuate especially if your

457
00:18:44.039 --> 00:18:48.299
Internet isn't good so like if you have

458
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:51.000
anything around

459
00:18:48.299 --> 00:18:54.600
say anything around below 20 megabytes

460
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.539
it's not really good for streaming it

461
00:18:54.600 --> 00:19:00.480
can get very janky because you typically

462
00:18:57.539 --> 00:19:02.220
need twice the amount of bit rates so

463
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.600
like if you're doing a I think it's like

464
00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:06.179
a

465
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:09.120
something like this or is it not so I'm

466
00:19:06.179 --> 00:19:15.179
doing 45 so I have 45 kilobits per

467
00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:19.500
second that's 4.5 megabytes right so now

468
00:19:15.179 --> 00:19:20.820
if I go through I need to have an up I

469
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:25.620
need a half head I think it's like

470
00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:28.080
Upstream of at least nine in order to

471
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:32.160
maintain this properly otherwise it's

472
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:33.900
just gonna go through and be relatively

473
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.580
choppy

474
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:37.020
so that's a good setting

475
00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:39.120
um

476
00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:41.340
this is for

477
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:44.880
um browser Source Hardware acceleration

478
00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:47.820
there is some like hot hotkey so you can

479
00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:51.120
tell it how to behave when it's in Focus

480
00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:52.860
or autofocus typically once you do some

481
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:54.299
um when you do adjust some settings

482
00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.039
you're going to want to hit apply every

483
00:19:54.299 --> 00:19:57.059
single time that way it saves you

484
00:19:56.039 --> 00:20:00.660
settings and you don't have to go

485
00:19:57.059 --> 00:20:02.880
through and uh change them once again

486
00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:06.179
it's pretty much it for the basics

487
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:09.980
um feel free to follow my channel and

488
00:20:06.179 --> 00:20:09.980
for now happy nightmares
