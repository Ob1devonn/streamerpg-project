                The Needs And Wants

            <h3>
                Computer
            </h3>

            <p>
                One of my biggest most important piece of equipment is your pc. Reason for it, is because  without a pc it can
                be proven to cause several obstacles. How will you upload content? Where will the editing be done? That being said
                It would be rather ideal to spend most of not all of your budget on a decent parts (i.e. 32gbs of RAM and a decent
                CPU and GPU). <br><br>

                In my honest opinion, this could drastically demotivate you. If you are running hardware that does not combat
                the processing required to even render your material, it will cost more than just money, but mainly time.<br><br>

                With PCs you might be tempted to go the "flashy RGB" route and spend several dollars towards useless cosmetics when
                that's funding that could very well be placed into more efficient processing. So, probably avoid most labeled "gamer",
                when searching for parts. The key here is processing power. Come on think about. Without brains all you got is bronzes
                and that applies the same here. CPU, or Central Processing Unit, and the GPU, Graphic Processing Unit, are gonna be
                the guts and glory. I'd err on the side caution with buying any parts as secondhand (unless you know the seller personally)<br><br>

                <em>CPU</em> will however be the most important. Majority of your live processing goes to this unit for just about everything.
                Think of this as the <em>brains</em> of the operation. It processes, routes, allots, and tons more. This will be either your most,
                or second most expensive part, but the most essential. Intel and AMD are the biggest traders in this market. Intel tends to
                have the most power, but often tend to be on the more costly side. A lot of AMD CPUs tend to run cheaper and still provide
                the processing needed. <br><br>

            <p> 
                <em>GPU</em> is responsible for secondary processing, mainly for graphic oriented tasks. You may want the newest and coolest,
                 or even the ones that come as "founders edition", but functionality is what we are really looking for here. Nvidia and AMD are
                the main sellers, but with this part in particular I'd stray away from AMD. The reason for it is, because GPUs are not their strong-hand 
                here.<br><br>

                <em>Memories</em> anything stored, in the process of storing, or anything in between, is storage (Hard/solid drives) and memory (RAM). There
                tends to be mix ups when it comes to these items in particular, because they have some similarities. They both store, but one is temporary (RAM)
                while the other is more so permanent (SSD/HDD). When editing RAM is very useful in the sense that the CPU requires an area to store
                working progress.

            <p>
               Depending on the operating system in use, you choices may vary. If you have a Apple product, you may stray towards
               some of the more proprietary solutions (Final Cut pro/iMovie), but that does not mean you have to, considering some of these softwares
               apply to both Windows and macOS. My favorite, <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve" class="link">DaVinci Resolve</a>. This being a free option and having a relatively robust array of utilization
               that comes with it. Another route would be, Adobe Premiere. It does, however, cost a monthly subscription, but offers about the same
               resources DaVinci has, at a price. The choice, of course, being yours (go with DaVinci).
